# Global Superstore Project

End-to-end **Business Intelligence and Data Engineering** project using the *Global Superstore* dataset — from **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** in Python to **ETL processing in PySpark** and **data visualization in Power BI**.

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore and prepare the Superstore dataset for advanced data modeling and visualization.  
The goal is to extract key business insights that can drive profitability, improve shipping efficiency, and enhance decision-making.

## Steps Covered

### Data Cleaning & Exploration (Python)
Performed in **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.  
- Checked and handled missing data  
- Explored data distributions  
- Analyzed correlations between metrics  
- Visualized sales, profit, and shipping patterns  
- Extracted insights across regions, products, and customer segments

### Next Steps
- Develop an **ETL pipeline** using **PySpark** (Azure Databricks)  
- Load and transform data into a star schema  
- Build **interactive Power BI dashboards** for business reporting  

---

## Key Insights (from EDA)

- Most orders ship within **4 days or less**  
- **Sales and profit** are right-skewed — few large transactions dominate revenue  
- **Corporate** and **Home Office** customers are more profitable  
- **Central** region leads in sales, while **Caribbean** and **Canada** are lower  
- **Discount** has a strong **negative correlation** with **Profit Margin (-0.85)**
